1) Proposals
Proposal 1 : We can implement some form of a mutex for writing anything related to the Product inside the buy function, the acquiring of a mutex is atomic, so it's either acquired and I can't acquire it right now, or not acquired and free to acquire, and modify the Buy function to attempt to acquire the mutex on the Product collection, so if Node A and Node B both got the requests at the same time, one of them will acquire the mutex first and will continue executing the rest of the Buy function code then releases the mutex, and the second Node will be locked inside the mutex acquire function until the mutex is released by the other Node.
Proposal 2: We can implement or make use of existing message queues on top of the database layer, whenever a buy function is called, a message is inserted into the message queue, each message is opened and the functionality is executed by order.

2) MongoDB is used
Since we know that mongodb is being used, there is no need to implement anything since mongodb by default uses locking (similar to proposal 1) and concurrency control, meaning that any write to a specific document is either executed completely (atomic) or not executed at all, in our case if client 1 & client 2 both attempt to buy product 1 at the same time and we only have 1 in stock,at random one of them will buy it successfully and the other will see some error saying insufficient stock.
